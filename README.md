          -Click on the icon "code" in green and then click "Open with Visual Code". You should then be able to run the program with the debugger (if there are building errors just ignore them and continue running the program).
          
OPTION 2:
          -Download the code in Zip File and then extract the "Project-COMP559" folder to your desktop. Open this folder with Visual Code and you should be able to run it with the debugger.
